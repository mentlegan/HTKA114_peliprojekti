I heard from the old mercenary Grimnir, that deep beneath the mines of this mountain lies still countless gold veins, thick as a dragon's tail and lustrous gemstones shining in colors no dwarf has ever seen before. I asked him why all this treasure has been left unclaimed if it is as grand as the stories tell. The greedy smirk from Grimnirs eyes quickly turned into a serious stare as he told that \"something foul guards the depths. As if the darkness itself was alive. To go there would be a fool's errand\" 

I think his age has gotten the better of him. What kind of a dwarf is afraid of the dark? 
If there really is only darkness between me and the gold, then that gold is as good as mine. Time to head inside and set up a camp for the night. Perhaps I will even seal the entrance with some planks in case someone is trying to follow me and steal my riches. "
